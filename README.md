## Overview

I programmed a Full Stack Application which is a social media application named Chirrup. Here you can follow users, create posts and engage with people's posts by liking them, updating them and many more. 

I did this in Javascript with the help of using the NodeJs framework and libraries from the NodeJS framework like express, Joi for validation and SQLite for database management. 

I used the VUE framework for my front end and used the bootstrap style framework for the UX - User Experience.

This was programmed to a predefined specification which is here https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/MMU-SE/Chirrup/1.0.0/#/

I used the RESTful API for communications between the front end and the backend. Using the fetch library to handle API requests in the frontend.

For the backend I interacted with the database using the SQLite DB library. I structred this using the MVC structure pattern to make it look more proffesional, seperating the backend into three interconnected elements view, controller and model.

With the help of the Joi Library and access tokens i handled authentication and authorization. This ensured only logged in users can create posts, edit posts and enage with other people like follow them or like their posts.
I implemented profanity filters on the backend for posts to ensure any offensive language does not make it into the application.

## ImportantInfo
Before installing and running this application locally, there are a few things you should know:

Once it's up and running, you'll be able to create an account and log in. Passwords must be 8‚Äì30 characters long and include at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character.

After logging in, the dashboard will only show posts from you and your followers. Since a newly created account has no followers, your feed will appear empty at first.

To help you explore the app‚Äôs features, I‚Äôve pre-created an account with existing followers ‚Äî feel free to use it to view and interact with their posts.
